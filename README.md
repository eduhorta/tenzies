<h1>Tenzies</h1>
  <p>Tenzies is a simple dice game that is played with 10 dice. The goal of the game is to roll as many of the same number as possible, and score points based on the number of dice showing that number.</p>
  <p>This project was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a small application that aims to practice basic concepts of JavaScript like `useState` and `useEffect`.</p>
  <h2>How to Play</h2>
  <p>To start playing Tenzies, simply click on the "Roll Dice" button. This will roll all 10 dice and display the results on the screen. The player can then choose which number they want to score, and click on the corresponding button to add points to their score.</p>
  <p>Players have three rolls to try and get as many of the same number as possible. After each roll, they can choose to keep any dice they want and re-roll the rest.</p>
  <p>The game ends after three rolls, and the player with the highest score wins.</p>
  <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
